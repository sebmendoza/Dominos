A fun side project to automate ordering pizza during late night study sessions. 
Inspired by https://github.com/Magicjarvis/pizzapi and altered for ease of use and debugging. My code is in get_me_pizza.py.

You can customize the program to order your 'go-to' pizza order for an even quicker process.
